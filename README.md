## About

This repo provides scripts to install the (Linux-)kernel module **shiftfs** via dkms.   

### About shiftfs

shiftfs is a kernel filesystem for the Linux kernel.   
It provides easier uid/gid-shifting for containers and can be used for example with [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/) (see also: [Usecases](#usecases)).

shiftfs was made by:   
See [Credits](#credits)

### News

The official successor for shiftfs is now available.   

The original shiftfs (the version used in this repo) will still be available for:

- Newer kernel versions: **5.13** until approximately 5.16 and beyond ([Source](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxd-4-16-has-been-released/11547/16)).   
- Longterm kernel versions: **5.10** and **5.4**, with support until approximately April 2022 ([Source](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/shared-folder-between-container-and-host-is-cached/10725/12)).   

See **Overview of Branches/Versions** below for more information on each available version in this repo.   

#### Details about the successor for shiftfs

According to the LXD developers, the new approach is natively included in the linux kernel (in kernel versions **5.12** and newer) - so no need for dkms-modules in the future.    
Support for the new approach is implemented since LXD version **4.16**, and the transition will be seamless, so LXD will automatically switch to the new approach, if available.   
**Note:** For now there are some limitations though, as only ext4, xfs and vfat are supported as underlying filesystems for containers and volumes.
See [Comment 2](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxd-4-16-has-been-released/11547/13) for details.   
So if you use other filesystems, I recommend to use the original shiftfs for now, until it is fixed.

### Overview of Branches/Versions

There are different versions of shiftfs.c for different kernel versions, so I cover a few of them:

| Branch/Version: | For Kernel(version): | Further Notes: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [k5.13](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.13) | 5.13 branch | - |
| [k5.10](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.10) | 5.10 branch (longterm version) | - |
| [k5.4](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.4) | 5.4 branch (longterm version) | - |
| [Arch Linux Packages in AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=shiftfs) | for packages linux (5.13) and linux-lts (5.10) | - |

| Deprecated Branches: | For Kernel(version): |  Further Notes: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [k5.11](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.11) | 5.11 branch | Deprecated as the kernel branch is EOL. |

#### What about older versions?

shiftfs will most likely not work on kernels older than version 5.
Thus the only recent branch newer than 5 is 5.4.
See also [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/).


## Limitations

* **Regarding Overlayfs inside container:**   
shiftfs can prevent the use of overlayfs **inside a container**.      
A usecase for this is running Docker with the overlayfs-storage driver **inside a lxd container**.   
A Kernelpatch that solves this is available, but it's not included in the mainline kernel (yet).      
To my knowledge only Ubuntu included it (see [solved bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1846272)).      

  For **workarounds and more information** see:

## Usecases

* LXD:

  How to use shiftfs with LXD is described in [my wiki](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/wiki/Use-shiftfs-in-LXD)     
  and in the official Forum of LXD: [Usecases for shiftfs](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxd-usecases-of-shiftfs-volume-disk-share/7735) and [Trying out shiftfs](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/trying-out-shiftfs/5155).
