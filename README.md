## About

This repo provides scripts to install the (linux-)kernel module **shiftfs** via dkms.   

_Note: shiftfs will maybe be included in the mainline kernel in the future.   
At this point (to my knowledge) only ubuntu included it in their kernel._

### About shiftfs

shiftfs is a kernel filesystem for the linux kernel.   
It provides easier uid/gid-shifting for containers and can be used for example with [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/) (see also: [Usecases](#usecases)).

shiftfs was made by:   
See [Credits](#credits).

### Overview of Branches/Versions

There are different versions of shiftfs.c for different kernel versions, so I cover a few of them:

| Branch/Version: | For Kernel(version): | Description: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [k5.11](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.11) | >=5.11 (5.11 and newer) | - |
| [k5.8](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.8) | >=5.8 & <5.11 (5.8 and newer, but older than 5.11) | - |
| [k5.4](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.4) | >=5.4 & <5.8 (5.4 and newer, but older than 5.8) | - |
| [Arch Linux Package in AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=shiftfs) | >=5.11 (5.11 and newer) | Same version as k5.11 |

#### What about older versions?

shiftfs will most likely not work on kernels older than version 5.
Thus the only recent branch newer than 5 is 5.4.
See also [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/).


## Limitations

* **Regarding Overlayfs inside container:**   
shiftfs can prevent the use of overlayfs **inside a container**.      
A usecase for this is running Docker with the overlayfs-storage driver **inside a lxd container**.   
A Kernelpatch that solves this is available, but it's not included in the mainline kernel (yet).      
To my knowledge only Ubuntu included it (see [solved bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1846272)).

## Usecases

* LXD:

  How to use shiftfs with LXD is described in [my wiki](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/wiki/Use-shiftfs-in-LXD)     
  and in the official Forum of LXD: [Usecases for shiftfs](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxd-usecases-of-shiftfs-volume-disk-share/7735) and [Trying out shiftfs](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/trying-out-shiftfs/5155).
