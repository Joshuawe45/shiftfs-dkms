## About

This repo provides scripts to install the (Linux-)kernel module **shiftfs** via dkms.   

### About shiftfs

shiftfs is a kernel filesystem for the linux kernel.   
It provides easier uid/gid-shifting for containers and can be used for example with [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/) (see also: [Usecases](#usecases)).

shiftfs was made by:   
See [Credits](#credits)

### News

The official successor for shiftfs is now (partly) available.   
The original shiftfs will still be available for kernel versions 5.10 and 5.4.   
**Note:** The original shiftfs might also have intermediate support for kernel version 5.13, see [Issue 9](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/issues/9) for details.

According to the LXD developers, the new approach is natively included in the linux kernel (in kernel versions **5.12** and newer) - so no need for dkms-modules in the future.    
Support for the new approach is implemented since LXD version **4.16**, and the transition will be seamless, so LXD will automatically switch to the new approach, if available.   
**Note:** For now there are some limitations though, as only ext4, xfs and vfat are supported as underlying filesystems for containers and volumes.
See [Comment 2](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxd-4-16-has-been-released/11547/13) for details.   

The original shiftfs will still be supported for older kernels until approximately April 2022 ([Source](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/shared-folder-between-container-and-host-is-cached/10725/12)).

### Overview of Branches/Versions

There are different versions of shiftfs.c for different kernel versions, so I cover a few of them:

| Branch/Version: | For Kernel(version): | Further Notes: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [k5.11](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.11) | 5.11 branch | Incompatible with 5.12 and newer (see [Bug Report](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/issues/8) for details) |
| [k5.8](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.8) | >=5.8 & <5.11 (5.8 and newer, but older than 5.11) | - |
| [k5.4](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.4) | >=5.4 & <5.8 (5.4 and newer, but older than 5.8) | - |
| [Arch Linux Packages in AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=shiftfs) | for linux-lts (>=5.8) and 5.11 | Incompatible with 5.12 and newer (see [Bug Report](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/issues/8) for details) |

#### What about older versions?

shiftfs will most likely not work on kernels older than version 5.
Thus the only recent branch newer than 5 is 5.4.
See also [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/).


## Limitations

* **Regarding Overlayfs inside container:**   
shiftfs can prevent the use of overlayfs **inside a container**.      
A usecase for this is running Docker with the overlayfs-storage driver **inside a lxd container**.   
A Kernelpatch that solves this is available, but it's not included in the mainline kernel (yet).      
To my knowledge only Ubuntu included it (see [solved bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1846272)).      

  For **workarounds and more information** see:   
[Issue 2 of this repo](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/issues/2#issuecomment-614688392)

## Usecases

* LXD:

  How to use shiftfs with LXD is described in [my wiki](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/wiki/Use-shiftfs-in-LXD)     
  and in the official Forum of LXD: [Usecases for shiftfs](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxd-usecases-of-shiftfs-volume-disk-share/7735) and [Trying out shiftfs](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/trying-out-shiftfs/5155).
